# Cortical-Silent-Period-Analysis-App
This application analyse the electromyogram (EMG) signals and measures the duration of the cortical silent period (CSP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). 
This application will be used in Neuroplasticity research. 
MATLAB app designer is being used to develop the application.
Once needs to have matlab runtime 9.10 installed on their operarating systens to run the Software. 
The project is funded by the Neuroplasticity & Neurorehabilitation Research Lab at the University of Regina, Canada.
